                                <h3>Risks</h3>

                                <p>The use of the Platform and the Service may entail the following risks:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Virtual Currency transactions are irreversible after they hit the network and once a transaction is initiated by You, it can neither be canceled, modified nor reversed by Us.</li>
                                        <li>The values of VCs are highly volatile and tends to fluctuate, due to which there may be an increase or decrease in the value of the VC You receive after conversion. VCs are subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is always an inherent risk of losses associated with buying, selling or trading in VCs. It is also possible that the valuation and price of VC changes after the transaction has been initiated by You or while the transaction and You are hereby advised of the same. Under no circumstance shall NewFi be liable for any such changes or fluctuations.</li>
                                        <li>VCs are an as-yet autonomous and the largely unregulated worldwide system of value transfer between private parties. It is not backed by any government or commodities and hence may be susceptible to risks not generally associated with other forms of legal tenders.</li>
                                        <li>As VC is digital cash managed by a peer-to-peer system of networks, there is also the risk of loss of confidence in VC trading. The valuation of VCs is based on a supply and demand economy model.</li>
                                        <li>There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in these Terms of Use.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    You should carefully assess whether Your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading VCs.</p>
